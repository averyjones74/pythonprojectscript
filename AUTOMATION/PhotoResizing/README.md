# Photo Resizing

### Description

I built this program because my company needs all employee badge photos to be the same size for
posting in the employee directory. Photos are taken at multiple sites using different cameras,
resulting in multiple photos of different sizes each week.

This program automates the process resizing each photo and saving it in a specific directory.

### Functionality
- Image file resizing (of course!)
- Archiving
- Directory clean-up

### Instructions
Simply pip install the requirements.txt and run!
