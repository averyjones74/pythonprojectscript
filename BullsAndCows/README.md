# Bulls and Cows with AI
AB Guess is a game to guess 4 digits with bulls and cows.
the rule is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows).

I build an AI program with MonteC Carlo tree search. I test the program 100 times, it takes an average of 4.52 steps to guess the number.

You can run 
```python
./game.py --game_num=5 
```
to compete with AI. Players with less step will win (I can't beat my AIðŸ˜‚).  Good luck and have fun!
