# Contact management project

Contact management project is basically a console project developed using python and Sqlite databse,
which can handle CRUD operations easily,following project creates a new db. extension file in your local directory

## Basic feature available :

## About databse management:
I have used "Server-less database" for user to perform CRUD operation locally.

### Libray used in Python:
