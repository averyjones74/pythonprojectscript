# Just a Tic-Tac-Toe

These are not-a-new-thing python scripts for the game Tic Tac Toe<br />
<br />
But, this edition has two modes to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game<br /><br />
One of them is a casual mode in which you can invite a friend over to play the game as your rival!<br /><br />
And the other one is where you have a bot-mode where a bot will be your rival this time <br /><br />
You could play the game untill you get tired of it just by running the script once<br /><br />
Oh and, you could also switch modes after the game has ended <br />

# Input for the program:
* This part is a lil tricky but hey!, I have got some examples<br />
* You have to use co-ordinate system for a 3 X 3 matrix <br /><br />
* For a matrix like this(which will also be our game board..),<br />

* If you want to take the top-right corner:
  * You have to enter: "1 *space* 3
  * The input implies: *1st row's 3rd box*
* If you want to take the middle box:
  * Enter: "2 *space* 2
  * The input implies: *2nd row's 2nd box*
 
# Some things:
* Feel free to give any invalid inputs (*I might have covered them all ;)  *)
* If you could make the program run unexpectedly, be sure to let me know in the comments. *Why? Well, we are all learners, aren't we?*
* Feel free to suggest any ideas to improve it as well.. <3
* Last but not least, this program doesn't need any requirements. Just be sure to have them all in a single folder.
