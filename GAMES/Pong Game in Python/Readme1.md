About System
The project file contains python scripts (Pong.py). Talking about the gameplay, the user has to strike back the moving ping ball towards the opponent court. If he/she fails to touch the ball, then the opponent player wins that round. And the game will be over after the 20 continuous wins of the same team. The pc control of the game is also very simple. The left-side player has to use W and S keys to move or slide the stick, while the right-side player has to use up and down arrow keys. The gameplay design is so simple that the user wonâ€™t find it difficult to use and understand.
