# User Hash Generator

I used this script in a flask website to use another identifier beside user id. It creates hashes with very low possibility of collusion. You may consider its other use cases.

## Getting Started

To demonstrate generator, a working terminal program is integrated. To try, type in terminal:

`$ python3 hash.py`

Notice: 'python3' keyword may be 'py' or 'python' for your system. \\

To use in your own project, examine the code.
