### Find Longest Word
This Python script will find the longest words inside a *txt* file.\
One sample file is provided inside the *files* directory. The sample file is 
called *words.txt* and lists over 100000 english words.

You can place your *.txt* file inside that directory in order to find
the longest word in it. You will just have to use the name of the
newly added file (including the .txt extension) as an input after running the script.
