# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-learning

Image based detection of plant diseases is an essential research topic as it may prove benefits in monitoring large fields of crops, and thus detect the symptoms of diseases as soon as they appear on plant leaves.

You can use the ipynb file to train your model and then you can use that model for prediciting diseases in plants.
