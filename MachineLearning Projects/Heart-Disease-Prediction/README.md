# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
     There are many causes of heart disease, this project is to use Neural networks to predict hearnt attack in advance 
to prevent high righ risk of failure.

Note: The main purpose of this project implementation is to understand the working of Neural Networks.
