# Create an English Dictionary App Using Python 

In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map. It works in a similar manner just like the real world dictionary where all the keys are unique and of immutable data type.

In this guide we will be creating an interactive English dictionary which will not only allow the user to type in words to get meaning but also provide word suggestions in the case of a misspelling.
