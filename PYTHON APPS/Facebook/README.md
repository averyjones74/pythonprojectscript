## Note
My goal was to accomplish as much as functionality albiet complex as possible by using just tkinter and basic data storing modules. This is by means a finished or
perfect project. I'll try to keep improving it in the future. Your contributions or feedback if any to enhance or correct this project will be appreciated.
